# üè° BHPredictor

**BHPredictor** is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts the **median value of owner-occupied homes** in Boston suburbs. It is built using the [Boston Housing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/housing) (originally published on **July 7, 1993**) and provides real-time price predictions based on 13 key housing features.

## üöÄ Features

- Predict house prices in Boston with 13 input features
- Clean and interactive Streamlit UI
- Real-time inference using a trained ML model
- Based on the classic Boston Housing dataset from StatLib (Carnegie Mellon)
